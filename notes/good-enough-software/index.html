</header><p>Ben Franklin says that your <strong>knowledge</strong> and <strong>experience</strong> are your most important day-to-day professional asset. <em>Depreciating</em> assets.</p>
<p>New techniques, languages, and environments are being developed as we speak and the ever changing market can render your experience into irrelevancy.</p>
<p>As knowledge declines so does value.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>the ability to learn new things is the most important asset.</strong></p>
<h3 id=knowledge-portfolio>Knowledge Portfolio</h3>
<p>All the facts about computing, application domains, and experience.</p>
<p>Managing this portfolio is analogous to a financial one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Investors invest regularly (habitually).</li>
<li>Diversification is the key to long-term success.</li>
<li>Smart investors balance their risk and rewards.</li>
<li>Try to buy low and sell high for max. return.</li>
<li>Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalance periodically.</li>
</ol>
<p>Translating this to our knowledge portfolio:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan to use a consistent time and place away from interruptions to learn.</li>
<li>Know the ins and outs of the tech your are currently working with, but get your hands on MORE!</li>
<li>Take risks, but not so much you can&rsquo;t recover.</li>
<li>Learning an emerging tech before it is popular may have pay offs later.</li>
<li>A tech could be useless in months, brush up on techs and learn new ones</li>
</ol>
<p>Some possible goals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn a new language every year</li>
<li>read a technical book each month</li>
<li>read non-technical book each month</li>
<li>take classes</li>
<li>attend meetups</li>
<li>experiment with different environments</li>
<li>stay current</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re comfortable, move on, learn another one.</p>
<p>The process of learning will expand thinking and open you to new possibilities and methods. The <strong>cross-pollination of ideas</strong> is important, try to apply the lessons learnt to current project (tech or borrowing abstractions).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve now in a rhythm learning and someone asks you a question you don&rsquo;t know the answer to and freely admit it. Don&rsquo;t stop there. Take it as a personal challenge to find the answer, ask around, search online, not just commercial content, but academic ones too. If the answer is still not obvious, find out who can, don&rsquo;t let this slip! Talk to people to build your network and you&rsquo;ll stumble across more problems and the portfolio can continue to grow.</p>
<p>All this reading and research will take time. Time is running out so, plan ahead, always have something to read. Time spent waiting can be a great opportunity to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>Think critically!</strong>
Anything you put in your portfolio should be accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype. Beware of the zealots who insists that their dogma provides the only answer. <strong>Do not underestimate commercialism</strong>, just because it shows up first doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s the best match. Providers can pay to get to the top. Even books that are featuresd could have been paid.</p>
<p>A few questions to ask and think about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask the 5 whys</strong> : Ask-Answer at least 5 times to dig deeper. Repeat to get closer to the root cause.</li>
<li><strong>Who does this benefit</strong> : Follow the money can be helpful path to analyze.</li>
<li><strong>What&rsquo;s the context</strong> : 1 size fits all are rare. &ldquo;Best practice&rdquo; is best for whom? Prereq? consequences? short/long-term?</li>
<li><strong>When or where would this work</strong> : Is it too late? early? under what circumstances? Don&rsquo;t stop with first order thinking, what will happen after that?</li>
<li><strong>Why is this a problem</strong> : Is there an underlying model? how does that model work?</li>
</ul>
<p>Act! Immediately finishing this chapter, <a href=%22/notes/elm-architecture.md%22>I learnt Elm</a>.</p>
