<h2 id=background>Background</h2>
<p>After spending nearly two years in accounting and finance (AFM) and away from math, I was fed up with the &ldquo;hand-wavey&rdquo; nature of accounting studies. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the program; it&rsquo;s just that accounting can be fundamentally described as a profession that revolves around abstracting complex ethical problems in the world to relatively small sets of rules.</p>
<p>I officially started my first math term 4 months ago. It felt like a real privilege to work on logic problems that are only constrained by fundamental axioms and properties of numbers. Although the stress shaved at least 5 years off my life, I mostly enjoyed the spring term at home. In a weird masochistic manner - if you ask me, the persistent threat of failure and hopeless feeling of getting stuck on a mathematical proof is what really gives the math program its charm.</p>
<p>Anyways, my purpose for writing this reflection is that I&rsquo;m turning 21 this year, and a lot has already happened since I first entered university - that is &mldr; a lot for a kid who lived in the peace and comfort of suburbia his whole life.</p>
<h2 id=why-afm-in-the-first-place>Why AFM in the First Place?</h2>
<p>The promise of a public accounting career is a stable career and a linear progression of salary and responsibility from associate to partner-level (given that you secure a CPA designation). Sure, there&rsquo;s always the finance path - but if we&rsquo;re honest, everything we think we know about financial markets is getting turned upside down as we speak.</p>
<p>Back when I was 18, things were a little different for me. In deciding on a university, I needed to get paid throughout my studies to graduate and find some financial security as fast as possible. For that reason, an accounting program at uWaterloo fits the description to a tee, so that is what I chose.</p>
<h2 id=why-i-transferred>Why I Transferred?</h2>
<p>Nowadays, I&rsquo;m doing quite well for myself. I have all the runway in the world to pursue any career that I&rsquo;m interested in, and it feels like I&rsquo;ve got a lot of life left in me.</p>
<p>To start, I realized that professionally licensed careers, in general, didn&rsquo;t suit my interests well. The corollary is a career with more room for creative freedom and risk involved. Additionally, I want to make an impact. Thus, I know that I&rsquo;ll need some form of leverage to accomplish this. Lastly, I find the notion of mastery to be a satisfying pursuit, so any career I pursue must be interesting at a high level and intricately complex at a low level. At the moment, that career exists in the space of all things software. Through math, I&rsquo;ll learn foundational ideas about the behaviour of numbers and develop some good ideas about how to model the universe as we know it today.</p>
<h2 id=on-university-life>On University Life</h2>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of structured education, especially if it ends up costing a lot of money. Lucky (or unlucky) for me, the province of Ontario is willing to bear most of the financial burden because I&rsquo;m pretty much broke. However, a thought crosses my mind on countless occasions: do I really have to be here?</p>
<p>I have access to any learning resource I could possibly dream of on the internet, and I don&rsquo;t find it hard to just sit down and study for hours on end. On top of that, I&rsquo;m absolutely in love with the idea of rejecting all norms and creating a chaotic life for myself - it builds character, right?</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve concluded there is likely no other time or place that is remotely comparable to studying at a university in your 20s. Before COVID, the frequency of serendipitous interactions with other students was beyond even my own imagination (Beyond Ideas ðŸ¤£).</p>
<h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>All anybody wants is to be of use to society in some unique way. As long as I keep learning new things and have the skills and ability to contribute something to the world, I&rsquo;m satisfied.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much where my mind is at today.</p>
