<p>This past year and a half, I&rsquo;ve been trying to be more conscious of how I spend my time and the places I allow my mind to wander. Last week, I listened to a great discussion between <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8">Andrew Huberman and Dr. Anna Lembke on addiction</a>. It&rsquo;s a very long talk, but its highly relevant to today and I think it&rsquo;s worth a listen.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-addiction>What is Addiction?</h2>
<p>Addiction is pretty complicated to define, but the discussion suggests it relates to a skewed perception of reward/pleasure (dopamine).</p>
<p>A key risk factor for addiction is impulsivity - this can be generalized as the tendency to act on thoughts from the wandering mind. Addiction is something that everyone experiences; however, some people become addicted to socially rewarding habits (career, social connection, etc.), while others become addicted to things with social consequences (drugs, alcohol, etc.).</p>
<h2 id=whats-wrong-with-me>What&rsquo;s wrong with me?</h2>
<p>My childhood and early adulthood consisted of an ungodly amount of gaming and chatting online. Looking back, I managed to kill several hours a day and ruin countless nights of sleep by merely sending inputs through my keyboard and watching pixels fly across the screen. Nowadays, many of the world&rsquo;s most brilliant people dream of careers that revolve around engineering systems to better monetize our attention (social media, entertainment, games, etc.) - it should come as no surprise that they leverage our addictive tendencies.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, things like social media, entertainment, and video games have always been pillars of everyday conversation among people around my age.</p>
<p><em>Aside: These activities are some of the most effective social crutches in the 21st century, and I&rsquo;ve been guilty of all three. There&rsquo;s real social merit to participating in these activities - but there must be other ways of connecting with people.</em></p>
<p>Whether or not I was addicted doesn&rsquo;t change that gaming had real social consequences, adverse health effects, and consumed a material amount of compute cycles in my brain (and in my computer).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-i-solve-my-addiction>How did I solve my addiction?</h2>
<p>During the exam season in Fall of 2019 I realized I fell behind on my courses. In an attempt to catch up, I tried to avoid browsing youtube, social media, and gaming entirely. Through this process, I noticed myself impulsively checking my phone and clicking my bookmarks for youtube or social media. As ridiculous as it sounds, I ended each day <a href="https://youtu.be/H-XfCl-HpRM?t=2110">feeling mentally exhausted from suppressing thoughts</a> that came from my own mind.</p>
<p>After exam season, I really wanted to explore the discomfort rather than returning to my old habits. In absence of gaming and social media, I had a ton of free time that needed to be reallocated. To start off, I made an effort to address some of the unresolved obligations in my life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning my room</li>
<li>Paying bills</li>
<li>Sending emails</li>
<li>Organizing documents</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, I somehow put everything in my observable future in order.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-do-with-all-my-free-time>What should I do with all my free time?</h2>
<p>With COVID creeping up, my reliance on the internet skyrocketed; I needed to apply even more structure and discipline to resist any temptation.</p>
<p>For a brief period, life felt almost boring - I would quite literally sit in silence or go on walks to think about the intrinsic goals I wanted to pursue in the long run.</p>
<p><a href=/reflections/tf-math.md>Long story short</a>, I focused my attention on developing better intuitions about mathematics and programming. It turns out that everything becomes more exciting and rewarding when I expose myself to less dopaminergic rewards.</p>
<p>Whether it’s by a direct result of my newfound habits or pure luck, somehow, every bet/decision I made ended up consistently playing out in my favour.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve created a new problem; I have plenty of things I want to work towards, and it’s hard for me to find a compelling reason to do something seemingly ordinary like chatting online.</p>
<p><em>Could I have gone too far?</em></p>
<h2 id=on-the-podcast>On the podcast</h2>
<p>After listening to the podcast, I found that Dr. Lembke elegantly articulated many of the thoughts that crossed my mind during my &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; process: embracing boredom, impulse, truth, and over-stimulation. As a result, it was less of a surprise that it became easier to break all other habits - internet browsing habits, social media, etc.</p>
<p>However, the reality is that social media plays a critical role in communicating with people my age (especially during lockdown). Finding a balance will be a real challenge.</p>
<h2 id=open-questions>Open Questions</h2>
<p>From the very beginning, I recognized that deviating from social norms is inherently a dangerous game.
In other words, being genuinely weird opens up the risk of isolation and ultimately delusion. It&rsquo;s a conscious effort of mine to maintain some semblance of a social life while conducting these experiments.</p>
<p>For me, avoiding the temptations of the internet has nothing to do with being more &ldquo;productive&rdquo; per se, I just want to live a complete life. Anything that gets in the way of this should be reconsidered.</p>
