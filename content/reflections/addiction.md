*This blog post explores a highly personal topic that rarely comes up in my daily conversations - however, it reveals a ton about me and I feel like writing about it.*

{{< toc >}}

This past year and a half, I've been trying to be more conscious of how I spend my time and the places I allow my mind to wander. Last week, I listened to a great discussion between [Andrew Huberman and Dr. Anna Lembke on addiction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8). It's a very long talk, but its highly relevant to today and I think it's worth a listen.

## What is Addiction?

Addiction is pretty complicated to define, but the discussion suggests it relates to a skewed perception of reward/pleasure (dopamine). 

A key risk factor for addiction is impulsivity - this can be generalized as the tendency to act on thoughts from the wandering mind. Addiction is something that everyone experiences; however, some people become addicted to socially rewarding habits (career, social connection, etc.), while others become addicted to things with social consequences (drugs, alcohol, etc.).

## What's wrong with me?

My childhood and early adulthood consisted of an ungodly amount of gaming and chatting online. Looking back, I managed to kill several hours a day and ruin countless nights of sleep by merely sending inputs through my keyboard and watching pixels fly across the screen. Nowadays, many of the world's most brilliant people dream of careers that revolve around engineering systems to better monetize our attention (social media, entertainment, games, etc.) - it should come as no surprise that they leverage our addictive tendencies. 

Oddly enough, things like social media, entertainment, and video games have always been pillars of everyday conversation among people around my age.

*Aside: These activities are some of the most effective social crutches in the 21st century, and I've been guilty of all three. There's real social merit to participating in these activities - but there must be other ways of connecting with people.*

Whether or not I was addicted doesn't change that gaming had real social consequences, adverse health effects, and consumed a material amount of compute cycles in my brain (and in my computer). 

## How did I solve my addiction?

During the exam season in Fall of 2019 I realized I fell behind on my courses. In an attempt to catch up, I tried to avoid browsing youtube, social media, and gaming entirely. Through this process, I noticed myself impulsively checking my phone and clicking my bookmarks for youtube or social media. As ridiculous as it sounds, I ended each day [feeling mentally exhausted from suppressing thoughts](https://youtu.be/H-XfCl-HpRM?t=2110) that came from my own mind. 

After exam season, I really wanted to explore the discomfort rather than returning to my old habits. In absence of gaming and social media, I had a ton of free time that needed to be reallocated. To start off, I made an effort to address some of the unresolved obligations in my life:
- Cleaning my room
- Paying bills
- Sending emails
- Organizing documents

Eventually, I somehow put everything in my observable future in order. 

## What should I do with all my free time?

With COVID creeping up, my reliance on the internet skyrocketed; I needed to apply even more structure and discipline to resist any temptation.

For a brief period, life felt almost boring - I would quite literally sit in silence or go on walks to think about the intrinsic goals I wanted to pursue in the long run.

[Long story short](/reflections/tf-math.md), I focused my attention on developing better intuitions about mathematics and programming. It turns out that everything becomes more exciting and rewarding when I expose myself to less dopaminergic rewards. 

Whether it’s by a direct result of my newfound habits or pure luck, somehow, every bet/decision I made ended up consistently playing out in my favour.

Now I've created a new problem; I have plenty of things I want to work towards, and it’s hard for me to find a compelling reason to do something seemingly ordinary like chatting online.

*Could I have gone too far?*

## On the podcast

After listening to the podcast, I found that Dr. Lembke elegantly articulated many of the thoughts that crossed my mind during my "recovery" process: embracing boredom, impulse, truth, and over-stimulation. As a result, it was less of a surprise that it became easier to break all other habits - internet browsing habits, social media, etc.

However, the reality is that social media plays a critical role in communicating with people my age (especially during lockdown). Finding a balance will be a real challenge.

## Open Questions

From the very beginning, I recognized that deviating from social norms is inherently a dangerous game. 
In other words, being genuinely weird opens up the risk of isolation and ultimately delusion. It's a conscious effort of mine to maintain some semblance of a social life while conducting these experiments.

For me, avoiding the temptations of the internet has nothing to do with being more "productive" per se, I just want to live a complete life. Anything that gets in the way of this should be reconsidered.
