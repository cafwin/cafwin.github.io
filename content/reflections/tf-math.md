*This post will be one of many musings for parsing through my thoughts while I'm in the moment and documenting my progression (or regression) for future me*

{{< toc >}}

## Background
After spending nearly two years in accounting and finance (AFM) and away from math, I was fed up with the "hand-wavey" nature of accounting studies. There's nothing wrong with the program; it's just that accounting can be fundamentally described as a profession that revolves around abstracting complex ethical problems in the world to relatively small sets of rules. 

I officially started my first math term 4 months ago. It felt like a real privilege to work on logic problems that are only constrained by fundamental axioms and properties of numbers. Although the stress shaved at least 5 years off my life, I mostly enjoyed the spring term at home. In a weird masochistic manner - if you ask me, the persistent threat of failure and hopeless feeling of getting stuck on a mathematical proof is what really gives the math program its charm.

Anyways, my purpose for writing this reflection is that I'm turning 21 this year, and a lot has already happened since I first entered university - that is ... a lot for a kid who lived in the peace and comfort of suburbia his whole life. 

## Why AFM in the First Place? 
The promise of a public accounting career is a stable career and a linear progression of salary and responsibility from associate to partner-level (given that you secure a CPA designation). Sure, there's always the finance path - but if we're honest, everything we think we know about financial markets is getting turned upside down as we speak. 

Back when I was 18, things were a little different for me. In deciding on a university, I needed to get paid throughout my studies to graduate and find some financial security as fast as possible. For that reason, an accounting program at uWaterloo fits the description to a tee, so that is what I chose. 

## Why I Transferred?
Nowadays, I'm doing quite well for myself. I have all the runway in the world to pursue any career that I'm interested in, and it feels like I've got a lot of life left in me. 

To start, I realized that professionally licensed careers, in general, didn't suit my interests well. The corollary is a career with more room for creative freedom and risk involved. Additionally, I want to make an impact. Thus, I know that I'll need some form of leverage to accomplish this. Lastly, I find the notion of mastery to be a satisfying pursuit, so any career I pursue must be interesting at a high level and intricately complex at a low level.  At the moment, that career exists in the space of all things software. Through math, I'll learn foundational ideas about the behaviour of numbers and develop some good ideas about how to model the universe as we know it today.

## On University Life
Personally, I've never been a big fan of structured education, especially if it ends up costing a lot of money. Lucky (or unlucky) for me, the province of Ontario is willing to bear most of the financial burden because I'm pretty much broke. However, a thought crosses my mind on countless occasions: do I really have to be here?

I have access to any learning resource I could possibly dream of on the internet, and I don't find it hard to just sit down and study for hours on end. On top of that, I'm absolutely in love with the idea of rejecting all norms and creating a chaotic life for myself - it builds character, right? 

However, I've concluded there is likely no other time or place that is remotely comparable to studying at a university in your 20s. Before COVID, the frequency of serendipitous interactions with other students was beyond even my own imagination (Beyond Ideas ðŸ¤£).

## What's Next?
All anybody wants is to be of use to society in some unique way. As long as I keep learning new things and have the skills and ability to contribute something to the world, I'm satisfied. 

That's pretty much where my mind is at today.
