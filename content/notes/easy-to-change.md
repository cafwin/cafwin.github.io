There is one value to guide your decisions: __Easier to Change__ (ETC).

Ask yourself whether the decision you made complicated the system every time you save a file, write a test, fix a bug, etc.

Sometimes, you won't know if the change will make it easy to change and that's where you can apply 2 things:

1. Make what you write __replaceable__ that way it won't become a future roadblock (cohesive and decoupled)

2. Note the situation, decision, and evaluated risk into your books. __Leave a tag__ in the source. In the future, when that piece of code has to change, give yourself feedback on the past decision.
