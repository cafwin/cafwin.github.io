Ben Franklin says that your __knowledge__ and __experience__ are your most important day-to-day professional asset. _Depreciating_ assets.

New techniques, languages, and environments are being developed as we speak and the ever changing market can render your experience into irrelevancy.

As knowledge declines so does value.

Therefore, __the ability to learn new things is the most important asset.__

### Knowledge Portfolio

All the facts about computing, application domains, and experience.

Managing this portfolio is analogous to a financial one:

1. Investors invest regularly (habitually).
2. Diversification is the key to long-term success.
3. Smart investors balance their risk and rewards.
4. Try to buy low and sell high for max. return.
5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalance periodically.

Translating this to our knowledge portfolio:

1. Plan to use a consistent time and place away from interruptions to learn.
2. Know the ins and outs of the tech your are currently working with, but get your hands on MORE!
3. Take risks, but not so much you can't recover.
4. Learning an emerging tech before it is popular may have pay offs later.
5. A tech could be useless in months, brush up on techs and learn new ones

Some possible goals include:

- learn a new language every year
- read a technical book each month
- read non-technical book each month
- take classes
- attend meetups
- experiment with different environments
- stay current

Once you're comfortable, move on, learn another one.

The process of learning will expand thinking and open you to new possibilities and methods. The __cross-pollination of ideas__ is important, try to apply the lessons learnt to current project (tech or borrowing abstractions).

Let's say you've now in a rhythm learning and someone asks you a question you don't know the answer to and freely admit it. Don't stop there. Take it as a personal challenge to find the answer, ask around, search online, not just commercial content, but academic ones too. If the answer is still not obvious, find out who can, don't let this slip! Talk to people to build your network and you'll stumble across more problems and the portfolio can continue to grow.

All this reading and research will take time. Time is running out so, plan ahead, always have something to read. Time spent waiting can be a great opportunity to catch up.

__Think critically!__
Anything you put in your portfolio should be accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype. Beware of the zealots who insists that their dogma provides the only answer. __Do not underestimate commercialism__, just because it shows up first doesn't mean that it's the best match. Providers can pay to get to the top. Even books that are featuresd could have been paid.

A few questions to ask and think about:

- **Ask the 5 whys** : Ask-Answer at least 5 times to dig deeper. Repeat to get closer to the root cause.
- **Who does this benefit** : Follow the money can be helpful path to analyze.
- **What's the context** : 1 size fits all are rare. "Best practice" is best for whom? Prereq? consequences? short/long-term?
- **When or where would this work** : Is it too late? early? under what circumstances? Don't stop with first order thinking, what will happen after that?
- **Why is this a problem** : Is there an underlying model? how does that model work?
