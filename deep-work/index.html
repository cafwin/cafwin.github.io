</header><p><em>There&rsquo;s an obsession with &lsquo;productivity&rsquo; for productivity&rsquo;s sake; to me, deep work aims at the core of what it means to be productive and work on important things that take serious concentration. The podcast is 3 hours long, so it might help to get some context behind why you want to listen to this guy in the first place. Play the podcast while reading below, hopefully it will add to the experience.</em></p>

<h2 id=what-is-deep-work>What is Deep Work?</h2>
<p>Any work that involves someone to be intensely focused on solving cognitively demanding problems would be considered deep work. Think of anything that requires you to suspend ideas in your head while you work like programming, academic research, etc. Cal Newport can describe it best himself:</p>
<blockquote>
The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to concentrate without distraction on a demanding task (what I call “deep work”) is becoming more rare at the same time that it’s becoming more valuable in the knowledge sector. As a result, those individuals and organizations who put in the hard work to cultivate this skill will thrive
</blockquote>
<p>What I find interesting is that his definition of Deep Work also buckets the strategic work of a large corporate executive as deep work as well. In the same way that you need to suspend hundreds of concepts and algorithms in your head when programming, a corporate executive must suspend the interactions of hundreds of distributed groups of human beings in their head.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-cal-newport>Who is Cal Newport?</h2>
<p>Cal Newport is a theoretical computer scientist who studies distributed systems. There&rsquo;s probably no person who is more qualified to be providing thoughts and advice about how to design systems that facilitate efficient communication in the real world. I haven&rsquo;t read any of his books really, but the podcast reveals how he truly feels about some of these ideas. Observe the titles of his books <em>Deep Work, Digital Minimalism, So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You, A World Without Email &mldr;</em></p>
<h2 id=important-points-from-the-podcast>Important Points from the Podcast</h2>
<p>Cal touches on a ton of points in the 3 hour discussion, below are just some of the most interesting ones that I took away from the talk. As context, his book from 2012 titled <em>So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You</em> is about deriving passion from developing skills and using skills as leverage. The book titled <em>Deep Work</em> is a follow up about leveraging undistracted concentration in a distracted world.</p>
<h3 id=approaching-equilibrium-of-attention>Approaching equilibrium of attention</h3>
<p>Technology has increased the velocity of information so much that it&rsquo;s possible to go an entire day without ever getting &ldquo;bored&rdquo; and have nothing to do. Social media has played a major role in harvesting the attention of users and much of the internet has followed suit. As the knowledge economy grows and become even more cognitively demanding, the people who are able to cut through the noise in society and focus on deep challenging problems will be rewarded.</p>
<h3 id=context-switching>Context Switching</h3>
<p>Cal argues that context switching is the root of all problems preventing humans to think clearly.</p>
<p>A major problem behind context switching is the notion of introducing <strong>unresolved obligations</strong>. In a world with Slack, email, and push notifications, it&rsquo;s become common practice to make communication channels as accessible as possible. As a result, poor communication rules will result in constant back and forth between multiple people - creating an ever-growing ordered list of obligations.</p>
<p>Another issue is allowing <strong>emotionally arousing content</strong> to interrupt your work. For example, seeing something on Twitter that makes you angry or anything that spawns involuntary emotional responses.</p>
<h2 id=digital-minimalism>Digital Minimalism</h2>
<p>Technology has allowed us to accomplish things faster and better than ever before. However, some technology - namely social media, has spawned business models that are designed around harvesting human attention. Cal argues that if we can reduce every technology to the use case that we desire, we can capture all of the benefit while minimizing the downsides.</p>
<h2 id=shallow-work>Shallow Work</h2>
<p>After listening to an entire 3 hour talk about the value of deep work, you might start to believe that the only worthy pursuit is to work deeply on cognitively demanding topics. You might also wonder if everyone doing shallow work is miserable and coasting through their lives.</p>
<p>One of the points that Cal talks about is that anyone can still do deep work in virtually any domain - what many people would call &lsquo;craftsmanship&rsquo;. Engineers often talk about the pursuit of mastery - becoming really good at doing some given task at a level of complexity that the untrained eye perceives as natural talent or even magic.</p>
<h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The compelling thing about Deep Work is knowing the context behind Cal&rsquo;s background in theoretical computer science. You can see that he describes many of the concepts in Deep Work as a corollary to known computer science concepts: graph theory, CSP, concurrent systems, etc.</p>
<p><em>Update 08/16/2021: Just finished reading the book, honestly it felt like I didn&rsquo;t represent the audience that it was originally directed at. The book provides a ton of great arguments that support the &ldquo;Deep Work Hypothesis&rdquo;, however I was already convinced before I even began reading it.</em></p>
<p><em>Note that the book was published in 2016, a time when people needed to hear that Slack and social media were destroying their productivity. I&rsquo;d say that the book is best suited for two main groups of people: young people considering a career in the knowledge sector and managers who are inexperienced working with knowledge work.</em></p>
